- The purpose of this analysis is to understand how to utilize Machine Learning statistical algorithms to make predictions based on data patterns provided. In this challenge, we focus on Supervised Learning using a free dataset from LendingClub, a P2P lending service company to evaluate and predict credit risk. This reason why this is called "Supervised Learning" is because the data includes a labeled outcome.

- To complete this analysis, we use different Machine Learning techniques to train and evaluate the data with unbalanced classes. The dataset from the LendingClub has an unbalanced classification problem due to the number of good loans outweighing the amount of risky loans. 

- In order balance out the classifications to allow for more meaningful predictions and improve the accuracy score, we needed to employ various Machine Learning algorithms to resample the data. These algorithms include RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
